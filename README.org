* Dynamic photoionization models of proplyds
- Collaboraion between:
  - Tom Haworth, QMW
  - Tyger Peake, QMW
  - Will Henney, IRyA-UNAM

    
** First Zoom call [2024-11-11 Mon 10:00]
- Initial message from Tom
  
** Original models with Nahiely
- These were done from 2011 to 2013
- The code is in the repository proplyd-cloudy
  - [[file:../../Work/Nahiely/proplyd-cloudy/]]
  - https://github.com/will-henney/proplyd-cloudy
  - This has the following components
    - ~models/cloudycontrol~ is a python library for generating Cloudy input files, specialized to the proplyd problem
    - ~models/~ has other python scripts for orchestrating the models in order to converge on a solution for different angles of incidence, and then to stitch together these solutions, rebinned to a cartesian 3d grid, which is used for calculating observational predictions (maps, spectra, etc) 
- The output and other ancillary stuff are in the folder Nahiely-Will
  - [[file:../Nahiely-Will/]]
  - There is a git repo there, but it does not have everything added to it, and it is not published to github or anywhere else
  - This contains a program [[file:../Nahiely-Will/wjh-cloudy.py][wjh-cloudy.py]] that supposedly does
    : Generate Cloudy input files for proplyd models
    I am not sure why this is not in the other repo
